# Work done
- Finished writing new testing scripts and testing the extension works. An ADR for this is in progress.
- Node 20 has dependency issues - so using Node 16 because Mocha etc., in the code work with this version
- ESLint gives exit 1 even if there are no errors - converted to warnings but issues persist
- Lint issue fixing is still in progress
- Tested the plugin with file tagging thoroughly ensuring every feature works. Noticed there are unimplemented features in the plugin, we are looking into those.
- Finished making the video

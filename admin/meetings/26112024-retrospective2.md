# What went well?
- Everyone coordinated very well for the video, efficiently delegating tasks and finishing it on time.
- We get a lot of work done in the in-person meetings.
- Everyone followed the protocols for code changes well.
- Pull requests have discussions before merging on main, and team members assign themselves on a task and coordinate to get things done efficiently.
- Got a working main branch! 
  
# What did not go well?
- Everyone is usually busy during the weekends, so it gets difficult to hold meetings.
- A lot of efforts went into refactoring the code since the extension code is old and the tests do not work. So our progress for implementing new features has been affected.
  
  
# What would be nice to have going forward?
- We can segregate the tasks more finely to convey what each task on the project board exactly needs. Dylan showed us how we can do this better.
- Dylan could give us pizza

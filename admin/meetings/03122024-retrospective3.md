# What Went Well
- We broke down our tasks more finely to assign tasks. Using a general task to track all the subtasks makes the board look clearer.
- We have segregated the tasks more finely, which is good for communication about the tasks' expected outcomes.
- Everyone keeps working on the new features and brainstorming together.
- We are following the code review process well and having discussions before merging branches.



# What Did Not Go Well
- Some tasks are hard and need more discussion and collaboration. We should identify these needs when assigning tasks.

# What Would Be Nice to Have Going Forward
- Could have pizza during meeting for incentives and relaxation

# Work done
- Fixing ESLint errors
  - While fixing this, we noticed many features in the code have been half-implemented
  - Fixing the ESLint errors broke some parts of the code, so we fixed them as well
- Implemented Rename feature
  - Need to add a test for this
- Implemented file-click in the file-tagging menu
  - Need to add a test for this
- Implementing tests for base file tagging
  - Not sure if this is working well still
- Merging journal view to the main plugin
  - Still needs more work
  - Might have to refactor a lot of the code
  - Considering the time constraint, it may not be feasible to merge it
- ESLint workflow setup on GitHub
  - Fixed the Exit code 1 issue with no errors
We merged the pull requests and closed the issues based on these discussions. Updated the project board.

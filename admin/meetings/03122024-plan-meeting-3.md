## Plan of Action
The project has come to an end. As we work on adding new features, we will also start writing documentation and preparing for the final demo and presentation.

### Tasks:
- Add TODO and task features.
- Add a UI for vscode-journal by merging vscode-journal-view into our repository.
- Write unit tests and end-to-end (e2e) tests for existing features (file tagging and journal view).
- Create documentation for using our plugin and working with the code.
- Write documentation for the tests.
- Prepare a demo and slides for the final presentation.
- The project board has been updated.
- All assignees can be seen on the board.

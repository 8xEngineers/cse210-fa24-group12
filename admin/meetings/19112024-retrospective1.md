# What went well?
- The discussions are quite productive
- Everyone proactively assigned themselves to tasks which distributed quite well


# What didn't go well?
- We need to do more research while choosing the repos, we did not check all the tests correctly because when we checked the tests did not run.
- When we tried to run the tests, we faced all sorts of issues and we faced a huge blocker
  - We could not parallelize because of this blocker and progress became slow
 
Going forward, we are ensuring there is a working version in the main branch so everyone can fork and work on it.

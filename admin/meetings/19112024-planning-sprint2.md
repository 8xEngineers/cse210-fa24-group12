## Recap
- Merging the source code has issues. The tests fail.
- There are linting errors. We started using Super Linter which is much more strict than the ES Lint they were using
- ES lint does not work with the repository source code as well
- The extension tests they have on the repository do not work.

## Plan of Action
- Kirsten and Botao made the vanilla working version for main - linting errors changed to warnings and we do not run the extension tests.
- Madhusudhan is replacing Super Linter with ES lint on the Github workflow
- Jialin, Matcha are fixing the aforementioned extension test errors
- Akash and Sudhansh are also managing stuff in the repository (adding notes and project board update) and fixing lint errors

We updated the project board
We are attacking the test fixing parallely
- Some are trying to fix the code for the current tests - Botao, Hanzhe
- Some are trying to rewrite the tests and correct the versions - Kirsten, Jialin
- Some are fixing the lint errors - Akash, Matcha, Sudhansh
- Some are working with Github workflows - Madhusudhan
- Merge the journal-view merging - Akash, Sudhansh
All the assignees can be seen on the board.

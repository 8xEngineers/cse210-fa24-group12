## Recap
- Merging the source code has issues. The tests fail.
- There are linting errors. We started using Super Linter which is much more strict than the ES Lint they were using
- ES lint does not work with the repository source code as well
- The extension tests they have on the repository do not work.

## Plan of Action
- Kirsten and Botao made the vanilla working version for main - linting errors changed to warnings and we do not run the extension tests.
- Madhusudhan is replacing Super Linter with ES lint on the Github workflow
- Jialin, Matcha are fixing the aforementioned extension test errors
- Akash and Sudhansh are also managing stuff in the repository (adding notes and project board update) and fixing lint errors

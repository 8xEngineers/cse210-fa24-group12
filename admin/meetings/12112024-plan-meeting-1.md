# Project Plan
The main repository is chosen as [VS-code plugin](https://github.com/pajoma/vscode-journal)
The tasks can then be segmented as 
- CI/CD Testing setup
- Refactoring the code to optimize it
- Adding [VS-code journal view](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.vscode-journal-view)
- Adding [file tagging](https://gitlab.com/limelights/vscode-tag-files)
- Maybe we can check out other extensions provided in the main repo
